- 👋 Hi, I’m @OMGitsJoeMG
- 👀 I’m interested in music, art, gaming, reading, writing, geology, tennis, exploring, learning data science and coffee, which gerneally goes alongside all those other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any beginner-type stuff, as I'm learning still.  Eventually, I'd like to work on projects that pertain to any of my interests.
